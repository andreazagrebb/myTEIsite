                   <l>I find that my husband Mr Desmond Fitzgerald, left Mount
                        joy Prison, on Friday last so that he could not have received my 1
                        letter before his departure. I had been told at the Prison that he
                        would be able to write me and to receive one letter within the
                        first week. I waited to write him till I should have had his letter
                        which came on Friday morning: I posted my reply on Friday after
                        noon.</l> </lg>
                  <lg type="paragraph" n="2">
                     <l>I have just heard from him again from Dartmoor : it
                        appears they are permitted to write once and receive a letter
                        after arrival there.</l>

                  <lg type="paragraph" n="3">
                     <l>I think it very likely that my letter to my husband
                        was forwarded on from Mountjoy in which case he fears that it
                        may count as the letter he has the right to receive in Dartmoor.
                        I shall be very much obliged if you will write the Governor of Dart
                        moor explaining matters so that he may be given the letter which
                        I am now writing him to Dartmoor. As the he will not have another
                        letter for four months I am anxious that he should not lose this
                        one through a mistake.</l>
